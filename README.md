## How it works

1. The server listens for incoming HTTP requests on the configured port
2. When a request is received, it captures:
   - HTTP method
   - URL
   - Headers
   - Request body (if any)
3. The captured information is formatted into a message
4. The message is sent to your Telegram account via the Telegram Bot API
